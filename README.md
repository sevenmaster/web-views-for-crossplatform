A calculator, that calculates in a webapp, while its input (and speech output) is implemented as an native application.

This crude code was written for a (Abitur, German A level) exam. The focus was really more on presenting the idea of the project, that actually making it.

This code and the associated presentation is published because I believe in open source and it could help someone on day trying to create a crossplatform application using a web view or someone simply looking for inspiration for a presentation exam ;)
